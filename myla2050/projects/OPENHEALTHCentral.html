The Affordable Care Act is increasing the number of people with access to health insurance in Los Angeles, but that won’t automatically translate into better care. 


Given the geographic, economic, and social disparities here, meeting the needs of our residents is a huge challenge. After all, L.A. County&#39;s healthcare systems serve more people than any other place in America. When the newly insured enter the system, experts agree they will bring with them significant health needs and social circumstances that will make it especially difficult to take full advantage of healthcare services. This population is often treated at clinics where caseloads are high, funding is minimal, and compensation is restricted to face-to-face services only. On top of that, a shortage of primary-care doctors in these communities already makes it more difficult to help patients achieve optimal health. 


Fortunately, these challenges offer an opportunity to cultivate innovative solutions that enhance the healthy connections between clinics and the populations they serve, and which will forge partnerships with the power to systematically improve care for everyone in Los Angeles. 


While there are many promising political, economic, and social initiatives underway to create a more equitable and effective healthcare system in the county, we cannot allow the connection between healthcare providers and their patients to be the weak link. Specifically, primary care practices are already struggling to serve people with complex chronic conditions in proactive, comprehensive, and effect ways, and if they don&#39;t have the tools to rise to the occasion, access to care will matter little. 


Among the most promising advances in clinical care is the emergence of physician-led interdisciplinary &quot;care teams&quot; that flesh out the &quot;medical home&quot; approach to managing patient populations. Care teams of community-based healthcare workers complement the expertise of MDs in ways that address the physician shortage while improving care and driving down costs.  These teams permit a more comprehensive approach to patient needs while boosting the number of patients a practice can manage. 


But how can Los Angeles increase the effectiveness of care teams at scale, thus expanding access to high-value care as the patient population expands?


We believe that Lybba&#39;s OPENHealth Central is a fundamental pathway toward a healthier L.A. in 2050. OPENHealth Central is a web- and mobile-based system that helps clinical care teams better manage the health needs of patients with complex and costly chronic conditions, while prompting patients to collect the kinds of information between visits that can dramatically improve their care and the system as a whole. 


OPENHealth Central is an open-source software service whose purpose is to put the &#39;care&#39; back into the healthcare system. It helps doctors and patients plan for visits more effectively, track experiences between visits, boost the quality of care and self-care, and provide the psychological support that comes from a rich human feedback loop. The system triggers action on the part of doctors, while also collecting data that drives evidence-based improvement in patient care, population health, and healthcare costs.


OPENHealth Central provides patients with effective ways to organize and use their healthcare information in order to be more active participants in their own care. 
Beyond helping people make and prepare for medical appointments, keep track of prescriptions, and decode lab results, OPENHealth Central also encourages people to set and achieve health goals through tailored care plans that offer both medical and lifestyle suggestions.  
 



OPENHealth Central will help clinical care teams:

•	screen, assess, and coordinate the care of patients whose complex health problems and social situations pose barriers to timely and economical care 

•	communicate with and monitor the health of patients remotely, in order to improve data quality while saving the time and expense associated with face-to-face clinical encounters

•	support individualized preventive, chronic, and acute wellness planning to keep people out of the hospital whenever possible

•	develop a primary care model of continuous personal relationships that are data-driven and accountable

•	increase patient access to healthcare and community assistance programs, facilitating &#39;warm hand-offs&#39; to people in agencies who can help the patient with their health-related needs

•	help ensure clinical quality data is shareable within medical practices and across hospitals and clinics

OPENHealth Central will help Angelenos and their care-providers lead more healthy and satisfying lives"/>

<p>OPENHealth Central is an open-source software service whose purpose is to put the 'care' back into the healthcare system. It helps doctors and patients plan for visits more effectively, track experiences between visits, boost the quality of care and self-care, and provide the psychological support that comes from a rich human feedback loop. The system triggers action on the part of doctors, while also collecting data that drives evidence-based improvement in patient care, population health, and healthcare costs.</p>

<p>OPENHealth Central provides patients with effective ways to organize and use their healthcare information in order to be more active participants in their own care. 
<br />Beyond helping people make and prepare for medical appointments, keep track of prescriptions, and decode lab results, OPENHealth Central also encourages people to set and achieve health goals through tailored care plans that offer both medical and lifestyle suggestions.  
<br /> </p>

<p>OPENHealth Central will help clinical care teams:</p>

<p>•	screen, assess, and coordinate the care of patients whose complex health problems and social situations pose barriers to timely and economical care </p>

<p>•	communicate with and monitor the health of patients remotely, in order to improve data quality while saving the time and expense associated with face-to-face clinical encounters</p>

<p>•	support individualized preventive, chronic, and acute wellness planning to keep people out of the hospital whenever possible</p>

<p>•	develop a primary care model of continuous personal relationships that are data-driven and accountable</p>

<p>•	increase patient access to healthcare and community assistance programs, facilitating 'warm hand-offs' to people in agencies who can help the patient with their health-related needs</p>

<p>•	help ensure clinical quality data is shareable within medical practices and across hospitals and clinics</p>

<p>OPENHealth Central will help Angelenos and their care-providers lead more healthy and satisfying lives</p>

    <p>OPENHealth Central is being designed by Lybba, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in Los Angeles that designs networks, tools, and events that help people better care for themselves and one another. We design networks of patients, physicians, and researchers in collaborations that create breakthrough solutions.</p>

<p>Over the past three years Lybba is a founding designer of the Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N), a new model for devising and testing innovations in clinical care and research. We are designing tools that help patients track their health between appointments, visualize their health over time via clear and engaging graphics, communicate with physicians using online and mobile applications, and choose to share their medical data with other patients and researchers. By increasing patient engagement, the C3N can transform the experience and outcomes of illness, and accelerate the discovery and application of new knowledge. (Supported by the National Institutes of Health.) </p>

<p>Lybba is currently designing and building an automated decision-support aid for doctors and patients to use together to achieve better outcomes. By using this software product, patients with serious chronic illnesses will arrive at decisions about the treatment options most suitable to their particular situation. (Supported by a major L.A. research medical center.)</p>

<p>Lybba designed a Genetic Care Interchange that networks the collective experience of patients, researchers, and physicians, along with genetic information, to supply insight for creating new genetically defined targets for drug development. (Supported by southern California life-sciences company.)</p>

<p>Lybba designed a knowledge base of medical diagnostics, including  knowledge-sharing models for how potential contributors--such as MDs, patients, organizations, and others--will participate in the creation and cultivation of an online knowledge base of medical diagnostic information and techniques. (Supported by The California Endowment.)</p>

<p>Lybba is a co-designer of the Regional Resource Network of quality improvement leaders throughout the country. With the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, we are devising prototypes that will make it easier for people to develop, curate, and spread knowledge. (Supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.)</p>

<p>Lybba conceived of and created an immersive DIY bio-design event for high school science classrooms in partnership with The California Endowment and their Building Healthy Community initiative in South L.A. Biohackathon L.A. 2013 focused on career opportunities in the life sciences and the cross-application of biotech knowledge. (Supported by the California Biotechnology Foundation.)
<br /> </p>

<p>In addition to the programs above, Lybba has designed, constructed, and created content strategy for a dozen healthcare websites. Lybba has also produced two dozen films on science and healthcare with our film-making partner, Wondros. </p>

    <p>OPENHealth Central will be built in an open-source fashion, relying on multiple software and data providers to achieve rapid, widespread transformation of healthcare for the public good. </p>

<p>Brian Prestwich, MD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Family Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, serves as Medical Director for OPENHealth Central. We also have the support of Libby Hoy, founder Patient &amp; Family Centered Care Partners, which contribute knowledge, insight, as well as a test-bed for the OPENHealth Central. PFCC Partners is committed to building a community of health care providers, administrators, patients, and families to improve the quality, safety, experience and delivery of health care.

     <p>
           <b>:</b>
    <p>OPENHealth Central, at its core, is a data system that tracks the quality of the care experience, the care process itself, costs, and outcomes. It will provide much needed information to practice leaders and policymakers so that funds can flow where they will be of greatest value. </p>

<p>The Recovery Act (“Meaningful Use”) and the Affordable Care Act are leading patients, payers, purchasers, and the clinical leaders to demand information that sheds light on the true value of healthcare services. This historical alignment of payment for value has the potential to fuel the improvement of healthcare delivery in the U.S., but only if new metrics and methods are created to define value for all involved.</p>

<p>OPENHealth Central is designed to help provide better means to manage care, particularly at clinics in under-served communities and for patients with complex chronic diseases and their attendant co-morbidities. Costs associated with caring for these populations are staggering, and OPENHealth Central will provide the means for clinics in these communities to screen, care for, monitor, and collect evidence about these populations. This evidence-based model has the potential for creating the conditions for systemic change, particularly when such a software service is adopted by clinical care teams around Los Angeles using similar means for collecting and analyzing data about individual patients and whole populations.</p>

<p>Use of this and other systems across Los Angeles lays the groundwork for methodical multi-site clinical quality-improvement initiatives that can help healthcare providers demonstrate that their care is working and why. Such data will better satisfy the information needs of communities, private insurers, Medicare/Medicaid, and community-health researchers.  </p>

<p>Finally, OPENHealth Central will promote transparent and appropriate data-governance mechanisms that will ensure fairness, openness, data sharing and hence a more level playing field for less-powerful players in multi-stakeholder projects such as this.</p>

       
     </p>
   <h2 id="the-idea">How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.</h2>


     <p>
           <p>The personal, community, and healthcare costs associated with treating chronic illness are crippling Los Angeles; the costs associated with not treating such cases are even greater. The influx of newly insured people in Los Angeles is taxing an already burdened system, because a significant number of these families have serious untreated illnesses and challenging social barriers to negotiate. New strategies must be adopted now if we are to make headway by 2050.</p>

<p>OPENHealth Central is designed to help clinics better plan and coordinate the in-home and clinical care of patients with chronic illnesses before their conditions grow serious, complex, and expensive. Baked into the shape and purpose of OPENHealth Central is a data-collection regime that aids clinics in improving quality of care and reducing costs. In addition to directly benefitting the patients and clinics using OPENHealth Central, these data will help identify which 'needles' to move across Los Angeles, helping to determine what is achieving positive results, and sharing those insights broadly. </p>

<p>These data, in turn, will provide policymakers and clinical practice leaders the information they need to channel resources where they are most needed. </p>

<p>L.A.'s current safety-net approach to healthcare (like the rest of the state's) is limited to face-to-face strategies, emphasizing the volume of medical encounters over the value of medical attention. This must change if we are to improve outcomes while decreasing per-capita healthcare costs. OPENHealth Central is designed to increase the volume and value of care encounters while driving down costs, in part by providing digital tools that make it easier to make care decisions more accurately and swiftly. </p>

<p>Community-oriented care organizations (such Lybba's collaborator, Family &amp; Parent Centered Care Partners,) strive to achieve the IHI Triple Aim of improved patient experience and care processes, improved outcomes, and better cost controls. But these organizations lack the computational infrastructure to make methodical and swift progress. Without data and the IT infrastructure to direct care resources optimally, even the most dedicated physicians and their care teams have difficulty discriminating between effective and ineffective care strategies. The business model for OPENHealth Central is centered around providing that infrastructure at low cost to clinical practices that would otherwise be unable to build their own.</p>

<p>The good news is that people actually will take better care for themselves and one another, especially when they have continuous, personal relationships with healthcare providers who know their case well and can help them achieve lifestyle and wellness objectives. Primary care practices in under-served communities are best positioned to be partners with these individuals, provided they have the tools they need to manage the care of their population.
</p>

       
     </p>
   <h2 id="the-idea">What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?</h2>


     <p>
           <b>:</b>
    <p>The healthcare system of Los Angeles in 2050 can keep people informed, connected, and ideally out of the hospital via a continuous care model that saves time, money, and lives. It can provide care-providers better ways to connect with their patients and each another, enabling more continuous and symmetrical flows of information. </p>

<p>Currently, only half the U.S. population with chronic illness receives the care they need, and only half of those patients successfully follow the wellness plans provided by their physicians. Depression, diabetes, heart disease, renal failure, and other prevalent chronic ailments can quickly escalate without screening, monitoring, and timely intervention.  With so much data being produced by and on behalf of patients, systems will emerge to offer a more continuous model of care and that reinforces best practices and collaboration between patients and their care-providers. </p>

<p>By 2050 the Los Angeles healthcare system can serve the essential needs of the vast number of people who are currently ill-served by the current system. Those with the greatest need will get the attention they require because data systems will show that the benefits of holding back services are insignificant compared with the benefits of allocating resources evenly across the county. </p>

<p>By 2050 residents will have the information they need to care for themselves and one another. They will have the knowledge and means to keep themselves healthy, and they will know when there is no other choice but it seek medical attention. And they will get the attention they need at a fair price.</p>

<p>By 2050 clinical practices will be sharing information about how their patient populations are doing so that optimal care is evenly distributed throughout Los Angeles regardless of social status or geographic location. Primary care practices will be less dependent on MDs and less oriented toward managing bills sent to dozens of 'payers', and more centered around care teams led by physicians oriented around the needs of their patients.</p>

<p>These qualities will come to life because we will have used our know-how, passion, and community assets to create resilient networks of people, information, and resources focused around the needs of all residents, not just those with the most luxurious insurance policies. </p>

<p>Just as important, these systems will convert data into care insights and meaningful action, helping to ensure that patients have access to and control over their own health information. Los Angeles in 2050 will be driven by its residents not just because laws such as HIPPA say that they have a right to their data, but because systems have emerged to help us use our data to improve our own care and the care of the entire  population.</p>

<p>	</p>

<p>With the adoption of systems like OPENHealth Central, more meaningful relationships between doctors and patients will be possible. </p>
