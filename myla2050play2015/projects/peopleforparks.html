     <p>
           <b>:</b>
    <p>People for Parks tackles the problem of park scarcity in dense, low income regions of LA by transforming schools into Community School Parks for use during non-school hours, giving kids and families the outdoor space they need to lead healthy lives.</p>

       
     </p>
   <h2 id="the-idea">In one to three sentences, please describe your proposal.</h2>


     <p>
           <b>:</b>
    <p>People for Parks (PFP) will open six new LA Community School Parks for public use during non-school hours. LAUSD youth enrichment specialists will offer diverse programming with emphases on play, physical activity, nutrition, outdoor learning and community building. Use of school playgrounds as park space is a creative, efficient, inexpensive way to provide a park within walking distance of LA residents. Community mobilization by PFP and parent participation will keep these spaces sustainable.</p>

    <p>People for Parks works towards the day when all Angelenos can walk to a park. As part of this effort, we will open six Community School Parks in LA in 2016 and empower parents and community members to participate in park activity and sustainability so that these spaces thrive for years to come.  </p>

<p>Community School Parks (CSPs) are supervised school-site playgrounds that are open to the public on weekends, holidays and summers and feature dynamic programming carried out by school staff. </p>

<p>In 2012, PFP tore up asphalt, replaced it with grassy fields and tracks and opened life-changing CSPs at Vine and Trinity Street Elementary schools. Using the formerly closed school sites as space for physical activity has led to healthier living, better nutrition, family and community strengthening, documented improvements in academics and reduction in obesity. They also helped families feel safer about playing in the neighborhood, as school principals confirmed major drops in vandalism and other signs of trouble. </p>

<p>90% of youth in Boston and New York live within 1/4 mile of a park compared with 33% of LA children. The LA Unified School District is the second largest landowner in LA. Unlocking its school playgrounds on weekends brings parks to underserved communities, where parents are overworked and 86% of children are eligible for free/reduced lunches; 72% are Hispanic/Latino.</p>

<p>Opening six new Community School Parks means 25,000-30,000 more Angelenos will have access to a safe park 1/4 mile or less from home. Once afraid to go outside in areas with the highest reported percentages of gang activity, children and families will enjoy park time at their own school campus surrounded by friends and staff. </p>

<p>Residents will discover a vibrant park and enjoy programming run by dedicated specialists. Activities include organized sports, fitness exercises, intergenerational activities, art/crafts, storytelling, outdoor learning, gardening, ecology and multi-cultural events. Baseball clinics and other team-building activities held at the parks by our newest partner, the LA Dodgers, are in the planning phases.</p>

<p>Community members will also receive training and support on park programming, maintenance and shared use through our Incubator, which helps ensure CSP sustainability and scalability.</p>

<p>One parent says it all-- The park staff members lovingly assist our kids with crafts, sports and other physical fitness games and also keep the area secure for our entire family.”</p>

       
     </p>
   <h2 id="the-idea">Please explain how you will evaluate your work.</h2>


     <p>
           <b>:</b>
    <p>The first marker of success will be the opening of six Community School Parks. Park use statistics by LAUSD enrichment staff will evaluate the goal that each park serves at least 300-500 patrons per month for recreation and 500+ for special events. </p>

<p>Scores from LAUSD’s Physical Fitness Summary, statewide 5th grade obesity testing and academic scores will help us evaluate the quality and vibrancy of parks.</p>

<p>Surveys, youth enrichment assessments and interviews with school staff, parents, children and community members will also help us grade park effectiveness and impact on LA2050 dream metrics--park access, vibrancy, crime reduction, feeling safe in neighborhoods, intergenerational play, numbers in afterschool programs, quality of informal spaces--as well as fitness, health and community building. </p>

<p>General data from and consultation with the LA County Dept. of Public Health ‘Joint Use Moving People to Play’ task force will be used by PFP to maintain the quality of evaluations.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Spending time outdoors, "in nature", is essential for children and people of all ages. There are so many studies emphasizing the importance of outdoor play for emotional, physical, and spiritual development and health. Being able to run, jump and tumble or just lay back and look at the clouds is such a joy and so important. And, when a child, teenager or adult is feeling the stress of everyday life, a tried and true solution is -- "Go take a walk." Walking outdoors, with a bit of grass and trees around us is calming and nurturing. People for Parks is working to offer the essential gift of outdoor space/parks for people throughout LA. Thank you!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>As a southern California resident and a mother I believe the opening more parks through out the greater Los Angeles area is essential to the social and cognitive development of children and families. It's sad to see today's generation specifically children entertainment be an iPad or some form of technology children are growing up not knowing what the outdoors and parks are like. Looking back at my childhood my greatest memories was going with my family to the park and riding the bikes and enjoying nature. Residents of southern California need to come together and rebuild our community one way to implement that is to have parks need to be more accessible within the community.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Jane Addams would be so proud. I believe People For Parks are on to something great. Los Angeles is a growing city. It is growing in population, culture, etc. I have a younger sister who is 7 and I noticed that she enjoys going to the park. In all actuality, every kid I have encountered with loves going to the park. Children go to play, exercise, learn social skills, feed ducks, stay out of trouble, etc. Many people with children can agree that their child, or child they are guardians of, love the playgrounds. There are families who do not have the ability to transport their children. Having these parks spread across Los Angeles will give the families an opportunity to get to know one another. There can be social events led at these parks that can bring the community together. The parks can bring the streets to a calm and provide a safer environment. Children's safety is very important. The parks can be a safe haven for the children. Exercise would be good for the children as well. They can play games on the playground. Some of the games could be, "Red Light, Green Light," or "Mother May I?" It's sad to say that some children do not know what those games are. They are exposed to different games that were passed down from different households. Having new playgrounds can help the children expand their knowledge with each other. It can help them create friendships and build trust with one another, all from being able to work well with one another.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Growing up in small town Northern California parks were probably the largest part of my after school and weekend recreational experience. Moving to Southern California it seemed so strange that there wasn't a recreational park within walking distance and that kids were playing on sidewalks and in parking lots. It made me wonder where community events were held since there were no local parks to host festivals or car shows or Fourth of July celebrations or after school programs. Everything was concrete. There was no dirt or grass for kids to play in and no central meeting point for after school socialization. Kids need a safe, central place to go that they can play and socialize at. They need a place where they can let their imaginations run wild and engage in healthy competition by racing on the monkey bars or playing 'Hot Lava Monster'. Giving kids the opportunity to play and create and participate in friendly competition is necessary for their development and gives them an outlet for their creative energy and helps forge social bonds by bringing kids from all social groups to one area with a common goal of having fun. This program, as it has already, provide local children with a safe place for social interaction and creative release through the many programs it will offer, and the children being supervised provides a sense of security for the parents. This world is so full of concrete and technology that it is important to provide kids with outdoor recreation and leisure opportunities and safe locations to participate in them. Kids need to play. Kids need dirt and monkey bar blisters on their hands and grass stains on their knees and fresh air in their hair. They need to be given a reason to put their cellphones down and look past the computer screens. They need parks. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I believe every child in the United States should have equal opportunity to be a kid and have fun. People for parks are trying to do something great for the city of Los Angeles and for our future generation. Children need to be able to play outside and communicate with others. Playing with others builds up their social skills and keeps their bodies healthy. Children should be able to grow up into a healthy environment and taught exercising is fun and good for them. Also playing at parks keeps the children from getting involved with bad behaviors, staying out of the streets, and getting out of the house. Playing at parks gives children the freedom to make their own decisions, practice sports, and have fun. Without parks, it deprives children of experiencing play like other children in other cities. In order to keep our future generation healthy, happy, and not obese, there is a need for a park in reach of every child.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I grew up in Northern California and found it deeply disturbing to find that parks were not as accessible as it had once been at home. The fun and leisure I had as a kid where all tied to parks. Every time we wanted to have a family dinner, birthday celebrations, and play basketball we always went to Durham Park. Though it was mostly family cousins that i mostly played with; we would sometimes meet other children and we would play together. I support this proposal because I strongly believe that children should be able to play. In a world that is becoming so technologically advanced, my concern that the outdoor leisure will be overlooked on by future generations. This program will benefit parents as well their children to enjoy their community, and will hopefully spark a movement for the necessity of parks.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for parks is really on to something here.  Instead of going to all the effort of finding the land to build a community park, hiring a contractor to design the park, and finding a willing construction company to actually build the project; People for Parks are cutting out the middle man and utilizing the preexisting parks and recreation areas to benefit all members living within that community.  The cost difference between building an entirely new park or just allowing greater accessibility to existing parks would be massive and an overall excellent way to preserve the cities already dwindling budget.  The facts don't lie, communities with integrated parks have lower instances of childhood obesity, gang activity and other negatives that we know exist within certain areas of Los Angeles.  It seems absurd to have excellent areas for community play but they are locked behind fences and are only accessible to students that attend the school at which the park is located.  The two schools that have already implemented this idea of school playgrounds being used as community play areas have seen nothing but positive results, so a grant that would allow for six more schools to implement this same idea should also be greatly benefitted.  No city should deprive its youth population from a nearby park when there is one already in the area.  Open the gates and let the children play.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I believe that it is well worth it to help fund People for Parks to open the Community School Parks because play is such an important role in a child's development. Whether it's to increase their social skills, activity level or their overall health, being able to allow access to a safe community school park within reach of their homes is a brilliant opportunity for children and their families to get involved. It is so unfortunate that these children have to stay inside to feel safe. By opening these school parks will not only provide a safe environment for children to play in but also get the whole family involve in learning about nutrition, outdoor play, and socializing with other families. One of the most important part of helping children grow and develop is not only focusing on the child but also involving the family unit. Recently as well, I visited Esperanza Elementary School and noticed that the whole neighborhood surrounding the area lacked access to parks and when I did noticed parks, it was quite unsafe and far from the local neighborhoods. Having that experience recently and also my own childhood experience, I remember my mom was always afraid to let my siblings and I play at certain walking distance parks because the area was so unsafe and thinking back at it, I feel like these are how the families in L.A. are feeling. They are troubled between keeping their child safe but also wanting a place where they can be with their child, get active themselves and meet other families alike. And that, I believe are reasons why I fully support People for Parks goals. This amazing opportunity will only thrive the community and provide children and their families a safe environment to have fun in and improve their overall health through recreation. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I support People for Park's proposal. I believe this proposal will be a good way for families to spend time together on weekends and interact with each other. Along with typical playground play, families can have celebrations at the parks or even sports games where everyone can come together as a community. I know from experience, spending time in New York when I was younger, we would go to the park almost everyday. Children in Los Angeles should be able to experience this as well. 
<br />The only thing that concerns me about this is will there be any supervision or security at the parks? Playgrounds can often be used for drugs and gangs. Some of the funding received should be used for hiring a small staff, or even asking for volunteers to keep the parks safe for children and families to enjoy.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Growing up in the LA county, I was fortunate enough to have a park right across the street of my house and to hear that only 33% of children have a park within reach astonishes me. I had no idea that it was that low. People for Parks deserves all the funding it needs to help improve this statistic. I support this proposal because it will be essential to a child growing up giving them the opportunity to make new friends and become more active. Since children are limited the amount of play when inside a home, the idea of opening six new Community School Parks will break the limit of play a child can have. This is a great project that both children and parents will enjoy. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Working in recreation myself, I have seen the positive impact parks have on children’s lives. I was fortunate enough to experience this first-hand as well. I was fortunate enough to grow up in an area where I had access to parks, and my parents would take me there everyday. I then began volunteering for the city at a day camp that was located at a community park, and I now work there in hopes to provide the same opportunity to children. There is a huge need in LA to have parks within walking distance, so that children are able to have this same experience. LAUSD would even graciously provide staff at the parks to help engage children in physical activity and learning. It would also help decrease the amount of obesity of children. Not only that, but the children’s parents would also be benefitting from this. They too would have a space to be active and watch their children thrive.
<br />	This would not only benefit families, but communities as a whole. After school is the time where children are most likely to engage in risky behavior. If there were a park within walking distance, then children would be able to channel their energy into something both positive and healthy. Only 33% of children in LA live within ¼ mile of a park! This is outrageous. Children deserve to have a space for them to play and grow together.
<br />	Due to the high percentage of gang activity, many families in LA feel unsafe to go to a park. However, the brilliant idea to build a community school park would provide a safe and supervised space for children and their families. In addition, this would also strengthen families and allow them to have a safe space to spend quality time together. This could lead to the start of a new generation that participates in more positive behavior, is more active, and leads a healthier lifestyle overall.
<br />	Both parents and children featured in this video express their need for a park. With the positive outcome of their two pilot Community School Parks and near LA, there is no doubt that opening up six other parks will have similar outcomes. Every child has a right to have a safe place to have fun. These six new parks would provide just that. People for Parks is an excellent organization, and I thoroughly support them in their endeavor to serve their mission.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks is absolutely a project that I support. First of all being a part of LA county I believe this can be a great source of opportunity for not only children to be more active and social but also the for the parents. The idea is one that is genius in the way that rather than trying to find the space and then building new parks they are attempting to open schools on the weekends where existing structures and surfaces have already been designed to accommodate various activities of play for the youth. Furthermore this idea not only benefits the children as well as the parents but helps deter possible behavior that could affect the community in a negative way. Opening six community school parks is a no brainer that can generate a lot of good for families surrounding these areas.</p></div>

Playing is an essential part of a child's life that gives them the opportunity to not only get exercise but to form relationships with other children and express themselves in ways they haven't before.

  <div class="content"><p>I live in OC area where I have parks within minutes of walking distance and I see green parks almost everywhere I drive to, but I had no idea people and kids in LA area have such low access rate (only 33%) to parks. It's a such luxury what I have in my community compared to what people have in LA. People for Parks sees the needs of these families and children in LA where businesses thrive but the quality of life of these people are not taken care of by the community. People for Parks deserves recognition, as well as funding, for projects like these that take care of the fundamental needs of human beings, to LIVE a life and not just work a life. I would prefer to have parks that have grass, playgrounds, and tress for them, because that's what I value, the nature. But I know it'd take a lot more funding to create parks like these, just something that I think would be very beneficial ans satisfying for the people in LA. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I fully support People for Parks, because what this program is trying to do is great for not only kids, but also their families. I believe that parks are a very important component in any child's life, because children are all about playing, learning about new things, and also making new friends, and parks help encourage these activities for kids to make memories that could last for a lifetime. Also, People for Parks will help defeat obesity in children, provide more physical play, encourage parents to interact more with their children, and bring the community closer,  because we live in a world that technology is extremely dominant in everyone's life, from adults to children and this program will also help defeat that, because it will show that there is more things to do outside than just being on your phones or just watching television. So I fully support People for Parks and also their goal to open six Community School Parks. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks is doing a great thing here for their community. They realized that if we didn't have space to open more parks, we will work with what's already made for us, which are the playgrounds already built into nearby schools. This project not only brings the children together, but also brings parents together ultimately forming community togetherness. I feel fortunate that I  within walking distance of at least two parks and I know of five that are within a mile radius. It is shocking and unfortunate that a large amount of children of children do not have the same access I do. Parks were a huge part of my childhood and it brought amount many memories of making friends, horsing around, being free and spending quality time with my siblings and parents. This movement is so important for the future and following generations. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I believe that People for Parks should have the opportunity to open up more parks at schools. It is a great opportunity for children of all ages and even adults to play or exercise. The United States needs children to exercise more frequently because our obesity levels have gone too high. Many children may not have access to parks near by but if this mission works and they have a school near their home they could go to their park or playground. I do think that they should be renovated to be fenced off from the school so that people will not vandalize or do something harmful to the schools.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I support People for Parks because they have a clear mission that is based on helping the people of Los Angeles. Los Angeles is not considered a safe city and it is important for children to have a safe place to play as well as having a safe place for adults to enjoy the outdoors. This project will also help lower the obesity rate. It is also good for the environment because parks have trees, grass, and other plants. This may start a ripple effect and encourage other large cities to convert unused spaces into parks. My hometown is very quiet with a lot of wide space for everyone to enjoy and I think that it contributes to the low crime rate and the friendly demeanor of the citizens. All of the residents can benefit from People for Parks.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People For Parks is doing a wonderful thing by promoting this idea and making it their goal to make such a tangible change in the community.  There is a huge need for children within the city to have an outlet for their energy and a safe place to play and experience the world, and this idea is such a great way to make sure that happens.  Most children have parents that work long hours and don't have the time to take them to parks or bring them to places where they can play with their friends, so having a park close and within walking distance to each child would be indescribably beneficial.  Another reason why parks are so important is that studies show that children who don't have any creative outlets have a much higher likelihood of becoming involved in criminal activity and making bad choices, so I think it is great this idea is being pursued!</p></div>

I believe this is a great opportunity for the community of the LAUSD families to get out there and be active. It supports the idea of play, staying healthy, and safety and this is always a good positive idea that should be implemented across the United State where there isn’t many parks accessible to the community. With such a dense population alongside an area that is hard to locate a vacant lot to make a park, it makes sense to open up the schools that the family’s children already go to and have them spend time there. Children will be more comfortable because they will most likely see their classmates and that in return would make them want to go back again and again. Families who go would know that their children are in a safe environment and have a sense of security knowing that their kids aren't out on the streets of Los Angeles in harm’s way.

  <div class="content"><p>Parks are such an important part of the community and the fact that Los Angeles only has 33% in walking distance is something that needs to change. Parks are not only important for the health of the youth and their families but also for community attachment. This emotional connection and loyalty that attachment brings is the stepping stone for more parks in the future. People for Parks’ Community School Parks is a movement that will bring this sense of community attachment. It will socialize more families in the local neighborhoods, encourage children and their families to be more active and will create more awareness and togetherness in the community. These factors also play a key role in decreasing crime, which is something that LA continually faces. Parks are a way for families to feel safer when playing in their neighborhood and also keep kids busy and out of trouble. People for Parks’ Community School Parks are important for bringing health, safety, attachment, and outdoor play into the community. It is a movement that is important for the present and for the future of younger generations. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Watching this video makes me wonder "Why hasn't this been done before?". Living next door to a park myself, I know the importance of being able to being able to go to he park to play, exercise, or just relax. Children, and their families should have the right to be able to go to a park, being able to play, being able to exercise, and being able to relax. In todays society many of us are either obese or stressed. Parks will help us battle these problems. Parks will also bring people together - give people a sense of community, which will make the community safer. Parks makes people happier, and who would not want to be happier? Make people of LA happier. Bring them increased Quality of life. Make more parks accessible to them!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Play is something that as residents we sometimes do not believe to be as important or we believe that every child in the community has the opportunity of play but we are wrong. I believe People for Parks should be funded to this project because it is helping our community strive for the better. This program aspires to benefit the local youth by decreasing child obesity, encouraging physical activity within the community, and preventing these children from being on the streets. Although People for Parks is designed specifically to benefit the children, it also gives back to the rest of the community by creating new jobs for those willing to supervise these programs. Adults are also benefited by the opportunity to meet other adults and families in the community. Through these new connections and friendships people can rely on each other to stay active.  The LA community will definitely benefit tremendously from this by a new sense of attachment to one another and to the community as a whole. People for Parks is making sure there is an openness in the community and by having these parks it will create a social gathering for people, a new way for meeting others and a way for staying active over the weekends and even summer vacation. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I agree and support People for Parks. Their proposal of providing the city of Los Angeles with more community parks would bring the community closer. As a resident in Los Angeles I understand this cause because I know the difference a community park like these make. I have participated in events as a child during the summer and my experience was indescribable. Interacting with others who are not from the area and participating in physical and intellectual activities helped me become more open with others. Already we see changes with the few parks that are open during the weekends and holidays. There has been a decrease in obesity, an increase in aerobic capacity, intergenerational play, and more active parents. Making these parks available will increase play, safety, and making new friends easier while decreasing vandalism and keeping kids out of the street. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I completely support People for Parks proposal to open six new LA Community School Parks for public use during non-school hours because there is a change that needs to be made and they are really taking a positive step towards changing the lives of so many people in the city of Los Angeles. Children all over the world need to have the same access to parks and outdoor places to play. By opening 6 new parks in Los Angeles is going to make a tremendous difference for the community in so many ways. Recreation and play is so important for not only children to grow and develop, but is also important for adults in the community as well. Not only are they helping people in the community get out of their houses and become more active and healthy, they are also providing jobs for people in the community by hiring staff to emphasize play, physical activity, nutrition, outdoor learning and community building. These are all positive steps to making Los Angeles a better place to live and a safer place for children and families. The fact that Los Angeles has less than half the access to parks, with only 33% of children having this access, compared to 90% in Boston and New York is a huge problem and detrimental to children’s physical and mental health. Play not only allows children and adults to socialize and have fun, it aids in reducing obesity, keeping children and young adults out of situations that promote at-risk behavior, increasing health and aerobic activity, promoting intergenerational play, and more activity for parents with their children and peers. Los Angeles is one of the largest and most populated cities and should enjoy the benefits of this proposal.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I believe that this is a great idea. Primarily, more Los Angeles' children would be able to have access to  parks. Furthermore, not only would the children have access to parks, children would also be able to interact with other children and possibly develop social skills. Also, hypothetically, children will be able to interact with  a diverse group of individuals. Moreover, the children will be able to maintain their health by participating in these parks. Additionally, the community will most likely grow closer as parents may interact with one another in these parks.    </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks is making a great effort to provide a safe environment for children in the Los Angeles. It is widely know that Los Angeles can be a dangerous place especially for children walking to a park that is a great distance away. Opening up school playgrounds on weekends, holidays and during the summer will allow children and family to get out and play rather than stay home. Play is necessary for a child's development. It promotes socialization and interaction with other kids that is essential all throughout life. These parks will also help in bringing the community together. When a community has a togetherness because they know one a other it brings pride and the want to keep their community safe, strong and beautiful. I support People for Parks and their proposal for opening six Community School Parks.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I definitely support People for Parks because their mission is clear and they are trying to better Los Angeles as a community. It is a problem that only 33% children have access to parks in L.A because there is way more children than that. I believe parks and play are necessary for a child's development. Play exercises the mind and body and allows children to be themselves, make new friends, and it helps with their growth. Not only would People for Parks' be opening six Community School Parks but they would also be improving the school outdoor space. It will reassure students and parents that their community is safe and they will not have to drive out of their way to visit a park. It will also allow them a way to stay active, healthy, and bond as a family. Opening more parks to children and families who need it is a brilliant idea. Los Angeles and it's residents could definitely benefit from this proposal being passed.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks has made a great proposal in opening up community school parks for the kids and parents.  Not only would the kids have somewhere closer to play, the parents are ensured their kids are safe with funds also going towards staff supervision.  With more community school parks opened to the public, there will be a reduction of obesity and parents can also be active with their children.  With the parks open on the weekends, the children will have something fun to look forward to instead of being bored at home in the day.  These community school parks would definitely bring the community together and help everyone stay active.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I believe this is a great project for not only the City of LA but for Southern California. In saying that because in LA everyone thinks of the Hollywood, stars, sports, and no one thinks about parks for the kids. Projects like these need to happen more in LA because there are a lot of old buildings that are just there and no on uses them. Tear them down build a park for kids. The kids need places to throw a ball around play and make friends. Plus having more parks keeps kids off the streets and out of trouble. Even get parents out of the house and will bring a since of pride to the community that they can play with their kids. Kids are the future of this country if they can not have fun when they are kids they will just turn into something boring and stay home not driving to inspire. This project is what LA and California needs. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks has a great mission to bring access to parks and play space to children and families. They're idea of just opening up the gates of the schools is a tremendous and simple solution to the problem. Not only would People for Parks' bring play area for families to have fun at on weekends but it would also improve the school outdoor space. Children already feel safe at school so opening up the playground on weekends will make more kids want to come and have a fun time and see their other friends and families. Also have organized group things so everyone gets involved would be a great way for the families to stay healthy and involved in their kids lives. This is the easiest and best solution to bring parks to children and families in LA in need of an outdoor space on weekends. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I support People for Parks' mission and believe that opening up 6 more parks will be benefitial for the community of Los Angeles. If activities include organized sports, fitness exercises, intergenerational activities, art/crafts, storytelling, outdoor learning, gardening, ecology and multi-cultural events. Baseball clinics and other team-building activities held at the parks by their newest partner, the LA Dodgers, actually come to fruition, I believe the community would be able to come together and bond with one another. Parents would not have to worry about the safety of their children as much as they would if the parks were not made due to distance of the other parks. Parks encourage children at an early age to be more active and that it helps reduce chances of these children being obese or overweight. For the mental aspect of children, The socializing that comes with children playing with one another will indefinitely encourage children to be more open and allow them to be happier. These parks are necessary in today's society and should be funded in order to create them. These parks benefit everyone in the community surrounding them.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I do support people for Parks’ Mission. The main point for recreation is to benefit people in the community, students and children. My hometown is called “The city Park”, which is a city that builds as a park. Imagine that when you came out of your house and you are already walking in a park, how nice was that. It would be so nice to opening the six, new LA Community School Parks for public use during non-school hours. A walking distance to the park would benefit the community, students and children. They are able to access the park and enjoy their leisure time during their free time. Children can enjoy their childhood and leave playful memories as they are growing up. Students can relax their emotion after a long day of school. All community members can develop their physical and social life.  Society in now days are having enough pressure on every single of us. When we meets our basic needs, we need a simple, free place to release our emotions. The park is the perfect place to enjoy our leisure time with family and friends.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks (PFP) has come up with a very creative way to support the city Los Angeles.  I do support  expanding the pilot program.  Opening six new schools during off school hours is great for the youth in these proposed low income communities.  These children are at a very impressionable age and we need more programs such as these to give them skills they can use to be productive in their communities.  Growing up in a low income community in Los Angeles myself I use to take the bus with 8 friends to Cal State Los Angeles for a summer program similar  to PFP.  This program helped us all with focus and confidence.  However, this program was not easily accessible to us making it difficult for the rest of our neighborhood friends to attend. Six new locations is a great start, but Los Angeles should consider tacking on a few more schools to participate with PFP.

  <div class="content"><p>I grew up in Los Angeles and am familiar with the school being interviewed. From my own experience, having a place to play as a kid was only limited to the front yard of my apartment. There were parks around but our parents never thought they were safe places to play either. I'm happy to see programs like People for Parks' build better communities in our Los Angeles neighborhoods by making use of local facilities like these schools to provide a safe playing environment for kids. From what I saw growing up there are a lot more local schools compared to parks and what better way to make use of these schools than to be used as another playground for children when not in use. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I believe that People for Parks proposal to open six new LA Community School Parks for the public use during non-school hours would be of great benefit for the LA Community. As our community becomes bigger and bigger, families and their children need places where they can be active and safe. By being able to open this parks it would help parents become more aware of the importance of a healthy lifestyle. As a result, children will be exposed to the importance of being healthy. Hopefully by doing this, our children will teach their children and so on. Not only would children be able to be physically active but also it would give the families an opportunity to relax and be active if they choose to. Not only will it help children and parents be active but by opening this parks it would be a great way to makes them feel save. Being someone that was raised in an area that many would not consider safe, I can understand why some parents feel the need to keep their children and themselves at home. By opening this parks that will be supervised, it will help children go out with friends and play. As well as help parents get out of the house after a long day at work and just relax. Talk to fellow parents and get involved in the community overall. This proposal would allow both parents and children get fresh air and relieve the stresses of the day. In the end, I strongly believe that opening this six parks will help reduce obesity, allow parents to be social and relax, and most importantly teach children the importance of a healthy lifestyle and leisure.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>This would be a fantastic proposal. I would like to have more parks assessable to the public. We don't want children to be locked in at their homes to play. I feel that this time of age. A lot of children spend a lot of time at home and not playing outside. With the rise of computer age more children are spending a lot of time playing with technology than playing outside. We need to minimize the indoor fun time. We need to get the children to get out and expose themselves the beauty of outdoor playtime!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks' should definitely be able to expand more and provide more opportunities for kids to be able to go to local parks. Los Angeles is a very metropolitan and fast-paced city to live in in the entire country, which is why the LA county needs to focus on the issue we have with parks. Parks should be a place for kids to easily have access to. It is a place for kids to connect and play with each other, and it also teaches them social skills. It makes a positive impact upon children. I strongly agree with People for Parks' striving to open up more parks.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I fully support the work that People for Park's is doing not only for children and their families, but the rest of the community and the environment this will bring to the Los Angeles area.  It is so important for families to have access to parks and seeing how People for Park's is working to turn school playgrounds into parks is a great way for accessibility during non-school hours.  I support their mission of providing supervision and LAUSD programming to open doors for children to learn about recreation, free play, fitness, outdoor learning, etc.  In addition, they also aim to reduce obesity, increase aerobic capacity, promote intergenerational play, and provide a space for parents to be more involved with their children and be active as well.  It's amazing to see how much forming these six new parks can change the entire community by providing a safe space for the community to experience life in a positive way.      </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>As a person who's worked with fostered, underprivileged, and incarcerated youth, I know how vital a safe open space for freedom to play is for youth in these communities. A child should not have to worry about being afraid of violence occurring and/or being intimidated. Childhood is grounded in play and growth accompanying other children just like them. Parks essentially make a HUGE impact in raising the quality of the childhood of our city's children. ALL our city's children. The environment in which a child is brought up shapes that child further along the way. Which is why programs like People for Parks are needed. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I fully support the People for Parks' proposal. The opportunity of opening six new community school parks for several thousand residents of the Los Angeles area will help create a safer environment, especially for young children. Similarly to New York and Boston, Los Angeles strives to open more parks to raise the percentage of kids (33%) that live less that a quarter mile of a safe park. This helps the younger generation fully experience their childhood and play outside, instead of being cooped up at home. Instead of watching television, playing video games, and/or interacting with their cell phones, children will have more time to play with kids their age and learn to socialize more. I believe that this is a great idea of children and adults. Families and young adults can also participate at these parks by volunteering, holding events, or just socializing and meeting other families. Therefore, People for Parks seems like a great way to better the lives of the Los Angeles residents. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>It a great idea, but who is going to supervise kids? Is there going to be volunteers or people going to get paid? Next, is when they get funds for the programs are they going to charge? Just like the parks they have certain programs that they charge like summer camp, joining a youth sport team and more? Will the school get money for doing this? If they do then that will help the school to have more budget. Even if they do open a lot of park like this then some school would not be able to have summer school, then wouldn't this be bad for the children. Cause they will be, behind in there studies? </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>"Opening six new Community School Parks means 25,000-30,000 more Angelenos will have access to a safe park 1/4 mile or less from home" This fact alone is amazing. If we can create a safe place to paly for over 25,000 families we could save our youth. According the centers for disease control, obesity is the leading cause of health issues in our children. encouraging our children to reduce the amount to time playing indoors in usual activities such as playing video games or watching television, can save their lives. We already have the land, the equipment and the children are familiar with the area, it only makes sense to open the gates at let the children play. Let them do what their biology wants them too and let them play. Children have so much energy due to their growing bodies they physically need to be active be stimulated and stay healthy. When they sit inside and repress their energy we see an increase in developmental and social disorders in our children. People for Park's is our chance to save our children and give them the access to a safe place to play and be children. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I think PFP is proposing a great idea and seems to have it all well thought out. I agree that children should be able to have a park in walking distance from their home because it is a key part in their development both socially and physically. The kids would not be the only ones to benefit from this project, but the parents would as well. They could socialize and interact with other parents, and just bring the community together as a whole. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I truly believe that People for Park's is a well needed project in California. Los Angeles is one of the largest cities in the United States containing a large amount the youth in our society. As a community we owe it to the future of our nation to take care of the children and do as much as possible to keep them safe and healthy. Allowing People for Park's to open more community parks on already existing land is a wonderful and lucrative way to increase the amount of play in our children and reduce the sedentary lifestyle that is currently threatening their lives. Obesity and developmental issues are the two leading issues that face American children today and play is one of the best and cost effective ways to solve both of these issues. By utilizing the land that is already in the community, in an area that is familiar to the children, People for Parks can bring children out of their houses and into a safe place full of their peers. It is all too often that children in urban settings grow up without access to a safe, healthy, and productive leisure actively. We have the opportunity to end this fact, unit families, and the help the community. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I believe that People for Park’s proposal of opening 6 new LA Community Parks during non-school hours is simply amazing! The fact stated that “33% of LA children live ¼ miles from a park” says it all. Children need exercise and space to move around and get active so that they lead a healthy and fit lifestyle. This will definitely help increase not only children, but families’ chances of obtaining that kind of lifestyle. Plus, a couple parks have already been open so there is evidence that this is something that will thrive. Personally, at some point during the summer, I always hear complaining from my nieces and nephews that they miss school and they miss playing with friends. What better opportunity to give them the chance to reunite with their school friends at a place that they and their parents know quite well. This is definitely a proposal that I fully support and hope that they receive the grant to further develop this idea.</p></div>

Our word is the gospel to these kids and it's exciting for me to see a program really understand that and take advantage of that. This program can keep kids out of trouble, off the streets, and teach them skills that will allow them to succeed in life.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I think PFP is a great program. I didn't grow up in LA, but where I grew up parks were everywhere and there was always one that was a walking distance away. I believe that every child should have access to a park that is close by to them. The idea to open local schools after hours is such a great idea. It would allow a familiar place for kids to go and play and be active. I support PFP because every child deserves a safe place to play. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I support this proposal. Every child should have the ability to play in parks not only during the weeks but also during the weekends of leisure time. Los Angeles has many available and beautiful parks. Supervision would most definitely be in place while kids are playing and it would also lower the stressed levels from many parents because would know their kids are safe. Opening six more play areas in 2016 would give children to play in different play areas on their leisure time. It would give children a better quality of life along with their families.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>This is a great proposal from PFP. Every child needs a park to play in as they grow up. Having this space for new parks will help out LA and its residents greatly. It will keep children off the streets when they are not in school. Gives parents a place to take their kids outdoors rather then having them stay at home all day. Childhood obesity in LA will start to decrease over time. The stress levels of the parents will be lowered. Parents will be able to make connections with other parents who live near by. Children can start to learn make different types of social skills in real life situations when interacting with other kids outside of school hours. They will grow to be leaders and problem solvers just by playing in a park with other children rather then seeing it on tv or on video games. I support People for Parks with this proposal because I believe just by having a safe place for children to play and interact will shape our future in LA. This proposal would be a huge success in the LA community.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I support People for Park's proposal for it makes everybody’s life better. Overall, by providing open space to children and family to play will reduce the stress of those who participate and take advantage of the opportunity while also benefiting others. Having less children playing on the streets and instead being in a familiar and secure environment is a great way to reduce their risk of harm and possibilities of joining gangs and doing vandalism. Furthermore, parents will be relieved to have their children playing in a supervised environment, where their children will be involved in healthy activities. This proposal of providing open space and programs such as sports, fitness, arts and crafts, among others will create social opportunities that brings the community together. Residents around the areas will feel more trust among each other as they create friendly relationships and will be more willing to cooperate with each other in other aspects and improve their community overall. Furthermore, opening school playgrounds during non-school hours will give an opportunity for children to be more active instead of being at home playing video games or watching television. This will reduce the epidemic of obesity and stimulate the children’s mental, physical, and social development.  With this parents and children will not have to worry about traveling at great distances just to do what everyone has the right to do—play. I support Peoples for Parks proposal for it is inexpensive and will, without a doubt, be a success. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Park is definitely one of the best organization to invest in if you are looking to improve the next generation.  Upon watching the video and read over their plans, I believe that People for Park will not only change the upcoming younger generation, but also the older generation in these areas.  Beside giving the children a safe place to play and have fun, these parks can also provide the same services to the parents.  Parents will follow their children's lead and together they can build a more close knit community.  I am taking a Recreation class in college, and it is really great to see that many years later, the ideas of pioneers such as Joseph Lee still lives on very strong. </p></div>

I support the six new parks that are hopefully going to get completed in 2016. The video highlighted for me the fact that it not only benefits the children a tremendous amount but it also helps out the adults by bringing families together. In conclusion, I fully support People for Parks because its goal is to improve the living quality and health of kids and their families. While also making for a much safer community as well.</p></div>

Due to the lack of parks in Los Angeles, People for Parks are trying to open school play grounds for for the public.This will give more access to parks in Los Angeles.The knew idea of PFP of opening school parks is amazing because it gives access to close to home playgrounds that children and their families can attend. Also, the fact that they are schools, adds a sense of security that parents can be comforted with. With this project, children will now be able to be more active and socialize instead of being stuck at home.I support People for Parks because opening more parks in LA will improve health of kids and their families, and will also make it possible to walk to a park.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks is organization that has helped children to become active, get involved in community, lower obesity, and keep children out of gangs or any trouble. Due to the lack of parks in Los Angeles, People for Parks are trying to open school play grounds for for the public.This will give more access to parks in Los Angeles.The knew idea of PFP of opening school parks is amazing because it gives access to close to home playgrounds that children and their families can attend. Also, the fact that they are schools, adds a sense of security that parents can be comforted with. With this project, children will now be able to be more active and socialize instead of being stuck at home.I support People for Parks because opening more parks in LA will improve health of kids and their families, and will also make it possible to walk to a park.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I support the opening of six parks in Los Angeles as it will improve the quality of life for children, parents, and the community as a whole.  I believe that the interaction of people and the availability of public parks is essential to building a community.  One of the main reasons I support the opening of these six parks is because of the relatively low 33% of children who have access to a park close to their home, compared to the 90% who have access to parks in New York.  It is clear that LA lacks parks throughout the city.  Parks provide opportunities such as interactive skills, physical activities, and a general appreciation of the outdoors.  Parks also promote the social capital that many children miss out on because they are so occupied with their smart phones and tablets.  Humans are designed to be outside and opening these six parks will definitely help people socialize, have fun, and relax.  People for Parks has my vote.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I think changing schools that have been shut down into safe and enriching areas for students and the community is a great idea proposed by People for Parks.  Opening 6 of these play areas give more people the opportunity to play and relax and at the same time allow parents to participate in activities that help bond families together.  Play also helps decrease the likelihood for child and adult obesity.  In my school district, there are 2 schools that have been closed for about 3-4 years. If they are turned into play areas for the students in the community, I believe that will be great.  After they finish the 6 new areas in LAUSD, People for Parks should think of expanding and collaborating their ideas with other school districts to create more recreational areas. Having these areas available for our community will aid our working class in reducing stress, pressure, and help children develop physical, social, emotional and cognitive skills.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I definitely think the People for Parks would be a great addition to the Los Angeles community. All children and families should have the opportunity of having a park they can walk to. Los Angeles has the perfect wheater to enjoy the outdoors but many don't get to enjoy it. So I support Psople for Parks without a doubt, it would bring communities together and children would be capable of enjoying the sunlight and outdoors a lot more rather than staying home and watching TV or playing video games. Children would become a lot more active and parents would also be able to build a stronger bond with their children. People for Parks would also help people release stress and get out of their daily routines for a bit. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I definitely support People for Parks’ mission! I think that it is a great idea to open schools to become parks for the community. Los Angeles is know for the multiple business and companies there, as well for the violence and crimes. This leads to lots of traffic and a lot of stress for the people there. I think through this mission there will definitely be a decrease in violence and crimes aside from stress. When people don't have the ability to play and be active, the other alternative that they turn to is violence and crime. With these parks opening up to the community, adults and children both will be able to play and socialize. Play is definitely important for kids to be able to learn morals, learn how to socialize, how to interact, and many more. Play is not only important for kids, but it is important for adults as well. Play helps adults socialize, bond, de-stress, and many more beneficial aspects. I strongly believe that this mission will change the community in a positive way. It will positively effect the community socially, physically, and mentally. I am all for People for Parks’ mission! </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I know that People for Parks would be a great addition to the city of Los Angeles because this will help youth and parents to be more involved in their community which would reduce violence, kids can develop better social skills, and these closer play areas allow them to be more active instead of staying home all day watching TV or playing with electronics. Sometimes kids go down wrong paths because they don't have anything else to do for fun so they might start hanging out with the wrong crowds, or they do things that might not be right or safe just to distract themselves because they are so tired of being at home. Besides being active kids will have the opportunity to learn new things, perhaps maybe things that might not be taught in school. Parents will feel more at ease knowing that there is a healthy and safe environment where their kids can go to spend time and have fun. These school parks are there, waiting to be opened, ready to be enjoyed by children and families who deeply need them.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I would love People For Parks to come to fruition! I grew up in a neighborhood where all the kids hung out with each other. We grew up together. And they were, and still are a huge influence on the person I am today. With this new generation, we don't see many kids playing outside anymore. It's all about the technology advances we have made. But the movement that People For Parks is pushing is a great concept that should come true! it's a great way to bring kids and families together. They can learn all sorts of physical and social skills that will help them grow into a well rounded human being. It's a great way for the LA community to get involved and put a great investment in the future!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People For Parks would be a great addition to the city of Los Angeles. It would provide a better environment for  children to socialize and get more active rather than to stay inside and be unproductive. Increasing the amount of play a child receives per day can change the outcome of their future in bettering there understanding of how things function,their creativity and response to skills that they could learn properly through play. This proposal has my full support since I have seen the outcomes of play, and I can see that LA lacks parks or recreational settings in which children and adults are able to go out and distract themselves from such a busy city. it is important for our mental and physical health to receive play daily, and the Parks for People will help improve those outcomes in the year 2016.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I highly agree with this idea. LA communities should open new parks for several neighborhoods. Some children dont have access to parks because it is far from their household. Even though gadgets will continue to exist. Children should still learn how to be physically active outside their house. Not only during school hours at the school playground but also at their own free time. Let these children enjoy their life as a kid. One day they will grow and dont have time to do this kind of stuff that is really fun. Also, More Parks equals to more fun. May not to all children because all are have their own meaning of enjoyment. But by means of having a time for visiting a park nearby that they could easily access, They can eventually make new friends on their community. Improve their socializing skills. Parks are invented for a reason, thats why we must provide it and use it. All in all, the LA communities should create more public parks that could be access by youngsters or children. It is for their own good, improving their physical, mental, emotional and social skills.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I completely agree with People for Parks to open six new LA community parks for public use during non school hours because it's going to be good for children. It will be a great idea because there isn't a lot of parks out there in LA or close to home to be able to be active and play. Most families are scared to go to parks because they fear the safety of their children and if they open more parks they'll be able to have staff members supervising. This will be great in my opinion because children and adults deserve to have a great time together. This way kids can interact with others and make friends because there are kids who prefer to stay home to watch tv and we need to encourage them that there is so much to do when you are outside. This will help them be socially active and parks are where they usually have a great time. It'll definitely help the environment become a better place.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I personally grew up in the city of Los Angeles during my childhood so I am aware that every kid does not have access to a park. Some areas in LA can be pretty rough and uncomfortable which makes sense why some kids stay inside or parents have a safety concern. Many kids/ teenagers get involved in gangs, drugs, and street trouble at early age. Having parks within walking distance could provide kids with team sports, recreational activities, and a safe community for them to socialize. It seems like obesity is a big concern now and a lot of this is up to us, adults to do something about and make a difference for future generations. I remember riding my tricycle in the alley next to my house, playing soccer in an empty lot that had electricity towers and running around the outside perimeter of an elementary school. These probably were not the best locations for me to play, but that is what was available. Thinking about it now, it's sad that the same elementary school I would run around had a track that was not open to the public. I meant to do no harm, I just wanted to run to lose weight and become a healthy individual. At the same time I feel like parents need to make an effort to take their kids to parks because when I was a kid my mom did not have a car, but she still managed to take my sister and I to the park and library even though we had to walk. Parks for people. </p></div>

The children are what matter, we create them to see the world in the manner they do. The parks are a good start in helping the children develop.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I would support this program 100%.  Most families don't have parks and recreational activities in their neighborhoods.  Opening schools up can provide families with a safe place to play and interact with one another.  It can bring the community together as well as promote a healthy active lifestyle.  Obesity rates are going up and the lives of many Americans are more sedentary because of work and technology.  Children will have a place to run around and learn socializing skills that will make them more well rounded when they grow up.  Parents will no longer have to stress about the problems of gangs and violence giving them a clear sense of mind that their kids are safe.  Hopefully this program becomes successful and is implemented in many neighborhoods.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Well, In my opinion funding for more parks in Los Angeles would be an excellent idea. With crime rates drastically going up, parks would keep young adolescents out of trouble. This will benefit children when they are not in school. Having more parks will allow these children to play rather than going out and getting into dangerous things. It will allow children to have a sense of play instead of sitting in the house playing video games all day. These parks will allow children to stay fit and energized outside. I completely support this proposal!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>In my opinion, the proposal that People for Parks (PFP) submitted stating the plan to open six new LA Community School Parks for public use during non-school hours will indeed benefit the children as well as adults. It is sad to hear the statistics of how far parks are away from the community. I personally lived next to a park back in home town in Santa Maria, CA and I can confidently say that it helped go outdoors more often with my family. It also helped me communicate with other individuals who I never met before. Play is important and in life and I hope this proposal goes through. I would like to see more people have access to these community school parks during non-school hours as well as weekends.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I am completely fond of this idea and truly believe it is a great one. Why? Because who wouldn't love the idea of being able to step out of there homes, and only have to take a few steps to there local schools in the neighborhood for a great time! People For Parks is outstanding because of so many reasons. One, being that is can definitely reduce obesity and even those are who close to it, makes thousands realize that fitness is a huge matter, and also promote a healthy lifestyle for both children and adults of any age! This idea is great not only for young children, but also for teens and adults because anyone can have fun outdoors. This can also most definitely help people improve their social skills; such as, help those who are quite shy and did not really have an idea of where to become social. Well in that case, this idea will certainly help because once you step foot on these playgrounds and parks there will probably be an endless number of people of all ages to social with. This idea should really be spread out and made happen in other counties and even better all over the country! </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I grew up in Los Angeles and am a graduate of the LAUSD. School playgrounds have been closed off as long as I can remember. Kids would go so far as to climb over fences just to get to a basketball court! Community School parks would provide a safe space for children to play and encourage exercise and a healthy lifestyle. What we lack in parks we can make up for by opening up our underutilized school grounds! This is a no brainer for LA. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>This is one of the most influential ideas by far for the next generation. Kids are the future of America. By helping them achieve success we our helping our community. Their physical and mental health should be one of our main focuses because we will soon rely on them to make the global decisions in our world. I am completely for this idea. Growing up in Los Angeles, I was fortunate enough to live next to two parks. Yet, one of them was never taken care of until now. I loved going to the park and playing with my friends. Till this day, I enjoy going to the park to hangout with friends and family. It is something that helped me expand my mind and make new friends. From all the sports I played in those parks as a kid, I was able to stay healthy and always have good energy. The idea of more parks will impact our community in a whole new way. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>This program should definitely be funded. What makes this project a no-brainer is the clear comparison to thriving citiies such as Boston and NYC. The model they have built has led to kids learning through play and in the process likely fostering creativity and new friendships. The funds that would subsidize these parks would likely be in large amounts, however, given that their are being sponsored by the richest baseball team in the world, funds are like;y not an issue. This is something LA has needed for a long time and hopefully they get it.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I like the idea of opening new parks to help the lifestyle of the people. Our country is very overweight and if these parks open and Los Angeles becomes more of a fit community, maybe it will open up ideas for other cities. PFP has some great ideas going here that will help not only children but adults as well. Adults will have less of an excuse on why they can't just go for a walk. I really like it for the kids as well. With today's technology, kids are constantly staying indoors and playing video games or watching television. If there were more parks around, parents may feel more comfortable and let their kids go out and play, they may even force them to. There are too many great benefits to not open more parks. Not only in Los Angeles, but it should be around the country.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I like the idea PFP is promoting physical activity by building six new parks. This will help encourage children to stay physically active as they will see it more for pleasure rather than a chore to keep our weight from getting to high. I think it is also important to build parks that are much closer for children and parents as well especially in areas where there is gang activity. Being able to build new parks allows children to develop social skills by interacting with other kids at the park and playing games with them. It is a good start to helping improve the community in LA.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I so support this initiative to garner more parks around these urban areas which are in need of them. I think its a genius idea to take already existing playgrounds and areas of play from school grounds and make them public on times when school isn't in session. Its insane that New York, the other second densely populated urban area of the U.S has more parks than LA. LA is bigger in size and population- it needs more than New York city! Overall this is great because it will give access to physical, social, and healthy ways of staying active and keeping kids happy. This will probably even reduce crime rates in those areas where gang activity is high. Once again i support this project wholeheartedly.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I completely support this idea because I have been to LA multiple times and do not really see any kids outside playing as much as I see kids out here in my neighborhood. I think that this will bring their community closer and they will be able to become more open with each other through play. In all, play can be helpful with obesity in young children, sure, but play has much more benefits than that. It provides children, and adults, with skills that they could either use presently or in the near future. With that said, play can give children the physical, emotional, and cognitive skills one needs in order to make deep connections with other people. In all I believe that play has benefits that can change people. With parks around LA, I will be able to see other kids and even parents and other adults actually going outside and playing. Nowadays we have phones which pretty much keeps us inside all day, but bringing out these parks can change that. These parks can bring people together and provide healthy state of minds through just playing a game of tag or just sitting outside in the shade, because we all know how hot it can be in LA sometimes. With that said, I will be looking forward to seeing more parks around LA and would definite go visit one on my next trip down there.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>It is evident that not only children need play in their everyday life. Bringing parks near communities will be beneficial to community members of all ages. As a child, i didn't live in an are with a park near by and it was not safe to play in my street , we moved into a home surrounded by 2 parks. This was such an improvement for me, i became much more active, gained social skills, and built a much healthier relationship with my parents and siblings. Supporting this improvement will have to be the best thing you can do !</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>The basic need of play is evident, not only in the physical aspect but the mental one as well. Nowadays, kids are growing up with the face glued to their computer or phones. There are several reasons as to why this is, but that is neither here nor there. Gone are the days where a kid can just go walk 10 minutes in any direction, play in the swings for 30, and come back in time for dinner. Of course, this can be due to L.A. being such a dense area with recreational areas being so far away from the communities. Utilizing the available space that is the school playground is a great method to encourage kids and adults to go out and enjoy the day. This is a great idea and should be supported by anyone who wants to promote socialization and health in all members of the community.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I did not know kids in Los Angeles lack parks. As a kid growing up, there was always a park nearby my school or I would go to the park with my friends on the weekends just to play. From playing at the park I got a good exercise each day and met knew people which helped with my social skills that helped me grow into the person I am today. Small cities like New York are able to put more parks in the area for the kids of the city to play in, Los Angeles, a much larger city which has more space to add a park should do so. People are worried about the parks being dangerous but anywhere in the city could be dangerous and it is just all a part of life and the only thing that could be done is open the park to allow the kids the play but then have the city have more regulations of police come by and the community watch out for each other because it is our city and we are one in the end of the day.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks to a great way to get communities in Los Angeles to get involved by adding 6 school parks that are walking distance because that allows parents and their children to walk together and even play. Having parks kids can go to everyday is great for their development. It can especially help them learn to play with others and helps them physically with all the activities they are going to have. Having the parents also playing with their kids can help reduce the stress they are feeling and they get to enjoy themselves without worries. These parks can help encourage kids and their parents to not use electronics too much and enjoy themselves at the parks because in our society we are too dependent on technology. I support this project because it will help build better social bonds with families and help improve their health. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I really hope you get the funding for your organization. This seems like a great way to get the kids and the adults to be more active. Being active is essential for a child's growth and health and for that reason alone we should be funding such programs, not just in LA, but in the whole US! It is also very fun to play and socialize with other kids. I remember when I was a young I loved playing soccer in the park with my friends and I hope many other kids get to have this experience as well. You have my vote!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Even before watching the youtube video, I was already all for it! I am so excited for this life changing project. People for Parks is an awesome organization and if project can come to life, it would bring surrounding families closer together. Through this, children will be able to socialize and play with other children, play is a very important aspect in a child growing up. Adults will also become more active and will spend more time engaging in their child's life. I truly believe that this project will be life changing and am beyond excited to see what it will bring to the community. People often forget that children and adults need play in their lives. Once again, I strongly support this project and I hope my vote, and everyone else's goes a long way!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I 100%, fully support the idea of using school playgrounds to promote better health, fitness, community building and play time.  I think it's a great idea to use land that's practically already there and built for play, to further expand playtime for the local communities after school hours.  Playgrounds are designed for one thing... play.  And to not free up those playgrounds for local communities to use when school is out of session, is just a waste of resources and money.  The idea of it bringing together communities is such an important aspect of our society today.  Everywhere you look, we have a community for something.  Even something as small as community of local basketball players to a large community of boat owners.  Bringing in all these people who want to be there for their kids to play, will strengthen and combine communities, allowing for new possibilities not discussed in their proposal.  Including networking towards new jobs, creating new friends not just for the kids but for the parents, and mostly importantly, it would boost happiness to such a higher level.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Creating this projects in the city of Los Angeles is an effective way to involve communities to participate and be involved to change the way in which children and adults routine life is. I like the idea that the schools will be open to communities(public) that do not have resources, parks, or time to enjoy a park, and apply play or free activities in their life. This program will impact communities physically, mentally and socially. The children will be motivated to play more and end their environments around technology, children nowadays need to play in more open areas in order to improve the way in which their brain and body develops. This project not only impact communities, it also help the cities to cut budget in the sense that having schools open every day is cheaper than creating parks, and it also its lets expensive to maintain them.At the same time, by maintaining this schools pretty to convert them in parks, children benefit because they can study in pretty and well maintained schools. The project have in mind to benefit families by helping them create strong familiar bonds, which at a long term goal can create more civilized and educated individuals. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>It is not surprising for me to hear that only 33% of L.A. population has a walking distance to access parks. When children do not have access to parks they look for alternative places to go to, which more likely are not safe and are not positive.  People for Parks project proposal of opening more spaces for children have access to is not only a great idea, but  it is essential. I support People for Parks and their vision. Not only are children going to greatly benefit from this project, but parents will also be able to interact with other parents as well. When families come together they will be better able to promote wellness, health and nutrition to their children. The children will be able to further practice their social skills by interacting with other children. The parents will feel attached to their community thus promoting safety and responsibility. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>The idea of People for parks really makes me happy. Seeing that there is a chance to give the kids in the community to play and interact with others and making them less likely to become gang affiliated just makes LA a better place. Because without play, they are more likely to be stressed and could lead to bad decision making.  This idea also incorporates the mothers and other family members which is great to bond with one another and even interact with other families in the community, making it a safer place and a good communication booster.  This potentially will help children get out and play and not be stuck inside due to the amount of crime in that area.  So lets make this happen,not just for the community, but the kids and their future!</p></div>

I like the idea that the Los Angeles Dodgers are helping in People For Parks mission to have every child in Los Angeles have access to a park. It's not all about the kids because it involves parent's as well which could be a good thing because them going to these parks will reduce there stress and spend more quality time with their kids.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I think PFP would be a great way for our community to be united. PFP would be a great way to change how children are being raised in today's society.It can also help by meeting new families and making more friends.  It is so rare to see kids out and about playing, having fun without their tablet or worrying about their video games. No child should be staring at a screen for so long, especially when they are very young. Every child should build their imagination with playing outside and PFP is beginning to do that. PFP is beginning to change todays society, one park at a time. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I think this is a great way to help kids to play outside instead of being inside all day and watching TV. Its an amazing goal that I'm sure will be accomplished because this idea is amazing. I would of wanted to have the opportunity to play and have others that are part of the community to be more involved. The video also was a reality check for LA we need to go to parks and exercise more. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I think its absolutely incredible what PFP are trying to achieve. Many people may not see it but play is a essential part one a persons life and continues to influence your life as you get older. PFP is not only starting these parks for children, they are starting them for the parents as well. I believe that it is unfair that only 33% of Los Angeles residents have a park near them. With the work that PFP is doing to help not only kids become more active as well as the parents. This movement can help the families not only socially but physically as well. Opening up these simple six parks I believe will help LA and the communities will benefit greatly. The People For Parks Organization is doing a excellent job in trying to incorporate parks and play into the lives of these communities.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>After watching your video and reading up on People For Parks, I am appalled that only %33 of children live close by a park in our own city.  I am in complete support of People for Parks and what they're trying to do, and I know that they will succeed in everything that they're hoping for.  Opening up six parks to the public in Los Angeles will not only strengthen our community, but enrich our community as well.  The ways this movement will strengthen our community are endless and that is why I am %100 voting to push this awesome movement.  Good luck to you guys and thank you so much for making our city a better place.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I can't believe that people in l.a don't have much activities to do because the parks are mostly far away from them and that there was one person in that video that her parents were worried about her safety. They want to be able to make the kids and parents in L.A more active so they won't end up being hermits in their house for the rest of their life's. The organization wanted to make parks for the kids and adults in l.a so that they can be more active and that they be able to have fun. They said by making community parks that it would decrease obesity and that it would increase acrobatity. The organization was thinking of making six parks in Los Angeles but cannot do it alone and that's why they need your help in order for the kids to be able to stay active and so that they would never have to spend the rest of their life inside.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>After discovering that the Los Angeles is one of the less recreational cities in the United States, I believe that People for Parks should be able to open parks in the city of Los Angeles. These parks will give the families the ability to go out and have some physical activity. They will also interact with different people in the community and build a stronger and safer community. I have spent lot of time in parks playing the sports and outdoor activities. Therefore, I agree that every community needs its parks. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks, and the opening of the school gates to become a playground, is a great way to get children in the community to interact and exercise through leisure.  Los Angeles children would benefit greatly from being walking distance from creativity.  Children would be able to expand their mind and happiness from simply being able to get out of the house.  Also, parents would be able to supervise their kids in a controlled and familiar setting.  I grew up across the street from a school that never closed their gates on weekends, holidays, or vacations.  I was privileged due to the fact that I always had a leisure safe haven.  Kids all around my neighborhood would interact with each other from sports tournaments, hide and go seek, or simply playing on the playground.  Our parents felt safe being able to monitor us from across the street, and we would play all day until the sun went down.  It was the best part of my childhood, and I strongly believe it would be life changing for other kids as well.  It’s becoming harder for children to be able to play outside and interact with others because of the consumption of technology and safety factors.  People for Parks will be able to change this with their new and innovative idea.  I strongly believe in this and support it one hundred percent!  </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I love this idea! I totally support the idea of having more parks in the LA area. It is definitely an innovative way to make use of school playgrounds outside of school hours. Los Angeles is a heavily populated city and having this expansion will provide children with more opportunities to play and grow. As a person who grew up in an area with a lot of empty spaces and parks and playground, I feel it would be a shame if the children of Los Angeles are missing out on these fun memories. Kids need a place to have fun, to play and to burn off energy. Not only will it benefit the children in terms of leisure, in the long run, it will bring great benefits to their health and well-being. I am definitely looking forward to seeing this innovative idea in progress! </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I support the ideas that People for Parks have in place and agree with their argument that not enough people living in Los Angeles have access to a park. I do believe that a park is essential to developing a healthy community and fostering positive relationships in a neighborhood. The positives that will come out of kids being more social and active will all around be great for the community and for the future of Los Angeles. I have worked with kids for over 5 years and can say that kids NEED this outside play space and interaction to unwind from any conflicts that they may be having at home or school. There is no reason why this land should not be getting put to use when it is just sitting there. Giving parents responsibilities can also help build a stronger sense of community and can help families feel more safe about their kids being out and playing in what tend to be considered less than safe neighborhoods. Do it for the kids! Do it for our future!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I completely support People for Parks and what they stand for.  Opening the six new parks in the Los Angeles community will benefit the people in great ways.  Everyone in each and every family will have the opportunity and place to play, meet, and get together. These parks have the potential to reduce obesity, increase aerobic capacity, allow for inter-generational play, and help parents become for active.  Kids need a place to play outdoors and do all the things they want to do.  You can't everything inside, nor do people tend to want to.  These kids will have a safe environment not too far from home to go and connect with other children on a more personal level while playing games.  Parents will be able to come and enjoy the fun with their kids.  I know when I was younger I always wanted to go outside and be active with the other kids on my block.  I was lucky enough to have a couple parks near my house that my parents thought were safe enough for me to go alone with my friends.  Those were some of the greatest and most vivid times of my childhood.  Every kid should have the same opportunity as the next and People for Parks is helping that happen.  I believe this is a remarkable idea since we know play is a necessity for life.</p></div>

It will give the community a safe place for families and children and will overall benefit the health and lifestyle of each and every member of the community. I fully support their mission and their vision and I feel like it is the best way to promote many things just as socialization, health, and fitness.

  <div class="content"><p>I 100% support the opening of these six new parks in the Los Angeles community. This is important for children and even their families of various reasons. Number one, the school parks are closed on weekends and during the summer, so children who want to play during these times are automatically restricted because their parks are closed. If there were public parks that were open at all times throughout the  year, children and their families could participate in sports and other forms of physical activity whenever they wanted to. Another reason that I support the opening of these parks is because of the shocking statistic of how many students in Los Angeles do not have nearby access to parks. This statistic was also shocking to me because in New York, it is 90%, compared to the 33% in Los Angeles. New York is a very busy and congested city, so the fact that more children have park access than in Los Angeles, that says something about the lack of parks in LA. Parks promote health and an overall better quality of life for children and their families, and it allows children to interact with and meet other children their age. It promotes socialization, interpersonal skills, fitness, and love for the outdoors. This generation is so reliant on technology to be entertained, so I feel that introducing new parks will allow children to put down their tablets, and go outside and play.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I very much support opening the six, new LA Community School Parks for public use during non-school hours because it is good for the community and can let families play with other families and help children meet more new friends. We have the good and best resources so I think we should use the best resources and share with the community, because playing in a  child’s childhood is so important. If in childhood, children cannot get a lot of play it will make the mental health bad. Children cannot always play inside. They should also play outdoors too. For example, football and basketball. Not only is kid’s play important, but adult play is as well and right now we have a good chance to let the parents play with their children. This can increase parent-child relationship. If we have a safe place to let the children play, parents don’t need to worry about the children’s safety. Weekends are family days. If open, the school parks can make the families have a big place to play together and have fun and relax.   By: WingSze

  <div class="content"><p>This is a great proposal which will allow various children and adults from nearby to have a place in which to engage in outdoor activities. It is also great that there will be adults around to supervise and make the place safe for children. What is really nice about this proposal is that it will be using schools as a substitute for parks which requires no additional construction.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Play is a necessity for your everyday life. So it is sensational that PFP are giving those families an opportunity to play in a close and safe environment. By opening more campuses to the neighborhood, it can help gain healthier lifestyles, and introduce more ways for parents to be involved with their children and interact with each other by playing games. The essentials that are provided to these children are wonderful because it develops new strategies for children to socialize, met new people, be more involved, and active. It brings the community together, and gives the children an ability to perform physical activity, rather than playing video games. The possibility of increasing the percentage of children encountering play produces an emotional reflection not only as a present action but also for the future because more children are going to be involved in the action of play. It's a remarkable idea. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Growing up I recall some of my fondest memories taking place at the park by my house. I was fortunate enough to have one within walking distance, but I realize that this opportunity is not currently available to many children. This is why I'm glad to hear that LAUSD is working hard to get this idea funded so that one day every child will be able to enjoy similar childhood memories as I did. It also has its health benefits to developing children who will be aided in their growth of cognitive, physical, social, and emotional learning that will help them later on in life. I was concerned at first with the issue of safety and vandalism because I'm sure many schools keep their facilities closed to the public for fear of such concerns. Luckily, the program includes individuals who will be monitoring and keeping an eye out to oppose unwanted corruption. I think this is a great idea that will help not only bring communities together, but also promote success in developing children. Apparently these parks will help lower the amount of crime in the area so I'm all for that. Humans are an interactive species and a park is the perfect place to do this while at the same time having fun. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>As a student in college, I feel like this project could actually make a difference in the LA community. Indeed, this could of course enhance Play in children and adult which is important to stimulate growth mentally, physically, emotionally and cognitive. It is also important, like mentioned in the short video, to keep kids and adults active to reduce any kind of issues like obesity and violence. It is true, LA is one of the top cities involved with gang activity and families are discouraged to step outside their very own home. But with a safe public school park, it will keep families motivated to be active, reducing obesity. I agree with jasmyn3327, adults could benefit from these parks since it is near by and can easily exercise at these free locations. I openly support this new upcoming initiative and sincerely wish the best of luck on these new six park openings! </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>This is a really good proposal. The LA area would benefit so much from opening up school playgrounds for the community to use during weekends, holidays, and summers. The parks are already there so we might as well use them! I think opening up the school playgrounds will really help create a greater sense of community and make it easier for both children and adults to become more active.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I think it is an amazing idea to open 6 six new community parks in LA. LA is one of the most busiest cities and the parks closer to homes will keep children occupied and fit. I personally live walking distance form a park and almost every day my brothers are at the park, whether they are playing on the playground, playing basketball or practicing for baseball with my dad. Adults even benefit from parks because they can easily exercise for free at nearby parks. I truly hope the parks will be opened in 2016 to benefit the children. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>As a kid, one of my fondest memories was playing during recess, spontaneously joining and forming play activities with other students. It made the act of forming social groupings more fun and less intimidating. Seeing a lot of these play areas disappearing one by one is a bummer, and I think this project is a great way to bring communities back together. Growing up in a small neighborhood, the sense of community was there for me, but when I moved to a larger neighborhood, that sense slowly faded. And considering the size of Los Angeles, I can see how this could be a top priority. People, especially kids, need to be exposed to play early on so that they can become more comfortable with their surroundings and others.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>I think it's a great idea to open school playgrounds to the community on weekends. It's my opinion though that the reason this hasn't been adopted by many schools in LA, is because of the higher risk of vandalism and liability issues if someone gets hurt playing on school equipment. I definitely think there everyone should have a park/playground in their community, as this would help kids to interact with each other face-to-face vs. virtually.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>As a student in the recreation field, I am in support of this idea. Overall, it seems children are being deprived of their leisure time in schools. While this topic is left in question, it is important to indirectly advocate diversion. These nearby parks will allow kids to play with peers and perhaps bring their parents along. Altogether, as it was stated it the video, one's health is essential for performance in life. In the end, these community school parks will develop the entire community. Best wishes, and I hope the final result leads to happiness in this busy society. </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Parks are essential to the health and well-being of any neighborhood.  Not only are they a place to walk, run and play but they are the place that brings people in the community together.  The social importance of parks creates and builds relationships - lifelong friendships are developed.  The wonderful advantage of Community School Parks is that the families who are already involved in the school can now expand those healthy aspects of exercise, social interaction and pride in their neighborhood.  It opens the space for the weekends -a break from the weeklong routine.  "The family that plays together stays together!"    People for Parks recognizes this as "SMART RECREATION" (J. Foley).  Research shows that having supervised parks with programs for children and families deters crime and builds healthy communities.  We need your vote starting Oct. 20! </p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for Parks (PFP) is a proven leader in the development and implementation of Community School Parks. Their partnership and collaboration with the Los Angeles Unified School District allows public use of school space and playgrounds during after school hours. With this designated "workable space" in place, People for Parks provides a practical, economically sound and efficient method and approach to establish outdoor play space in densely populated "park absent" areas in LA. The PFP concept further delivers the tools and training for parents and the local community to help ensure the viability of "their Community School Park." </p>

<p>This funding will assist People for Parks to continue and expand their necessary work with the establishment of 6 new Community School Parks and I champion their efforts.</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>This is an idea that could truly improve our city on a grand scale. Every child - every person! - should live within walking distance to a park to commune with nature and their community. Schoolyards are already in every community and are underutilized; they are the perfect solution. Plus, opening schoolyards on weekends and summer has been proven to make neighborhoods and the schools themselves safer! There is far less vandalism and neighbors feel more connected to each other and to their neighborhood schools. Schoolyards in New York City already function this way - Come on LA! Let's do this!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>People for parks is not only a brilliant concept, it is a critical concept for the Los Angeles Community. The community outdoor resources can be limited and this is an absolute necessity for children to get out. Kids need a place where they feel comfortable to run free; independently and with their family and <a href="http://friends.Community" target="_blank">friends.Community</a> parks are a complement to a positive growing family community. I am so excited to see the new six community parks flourish in this area. Thank you People for Parks for all that you have done and all you continue to do!</p></div>

  <div class="content"><p>This isn't just a good cause, it's a critical necessity. Los Angeles is a city of cars. For the children, what does that leave them? I live here and I know how few of our residents have access to park ground within walking distance. These school parks are there, waiting to be opened, ready to be enjoyed by children and families who sorely need them. And People for Parks have trained supervisors who lead the children in games and activities. It's such a phenomenal organization. The parks that People for Parks have opened and run up to now have made such a difference in their communities. Without parks, Los Angeles children have one of two options: run in the streets or stay inside. Neither is acceptable. And, neither is necessary. Let's please open these Community School Grounds to the neighborhood residents on weekends. As one of the principals in the video says, People for Parks's mission really is a no-brainer. </p></div>

Childhood should be about playing and growing, and not about fear, violence, and intimidation.  Parks can truly make a difference in raising the quality of the childhood of our city's children.  ALL our city's children.  </p></div>
